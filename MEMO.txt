Hydrothermal circulation + O isotope model
Oiso+HT1_v6.f90 --> calculate steady state O isotopes of rock and porewater; including dispersion 
v7 & 8: try to include spreading rate w 
HT1_v8uw.f90    --> Hydrothermal circulation without considering lateral free flow

To make steam library

$ g77 -c mylib.f                     # Compile the code
$ ar -rcs libmylib.a mylib.o         # Create the archive containing the code
$ sudo cp libmylib.a /usr/local/lib  # Copy it to /usr/local/lib

mylib replaced by steam
